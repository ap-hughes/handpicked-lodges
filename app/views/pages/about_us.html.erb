      <p>"My husband and I moved to Aviemore in 2010 to manage the growth and expansion of 15 holiday chalets and apartments in Aviemore. Where we have more than doubled turnover and profit and also designed and built 4 luxury lodges which now achieve over 90% occupancy. The experience and knowledge that I gained through this coupled with my prior experience working as a Chartered Surveyor in London made me passionate about taking these skills into a wider area.</p>

      <p>So in 2016, when I met Judith we realised that together our skill set could offer a great new way for both owners and guests to experience holiday homes in the Cairngorms.</p>

      <p>Our unique and hands-on approach has allowed our small business to grow quickly and achieve a higher than average occupancy, greater customer satisfaction, higher number of repeat guests and recommendations, and 5 star reviews across the board.</p>

      <p>My move to Perthshire during 2020 then presented us with the ideal opportunity to expand our offering whilst not compromising our hands on personal service.</p>

      <p>Our ethos is simple; we want to show you the very best of what our Seasgair lodges and Scotland has to offer time and time again."</p>

      <p>"As a child I spent many wonderful holidays exploring the Cairngorms, so when the opportunity arose in 2011 to move from Edinburgh to Aviemore with my family, I jumped at the chance and have never looked back. When we first moved, I continued to run my training and coaching consultancy, working with several local and national businesses in supporting the development of customer service and management skills within their teams.</p>
      <p>I have always had a very keen interest in property, particularly holiday homes - coupled with my passion for customer care and running my own business, this meant that Seasgair was the perfect next step for me.</p>
      <p>Tanja and I have a very similar ethos and values which have resulted in the rapid and consistent success of our business. We are dedicated to providing our guests with an outstanding level of service from their first enquiry right through to the end of their stay and we pay attention to every little detail to ensure that their expectations are exceeded every time.</p>
      <p>We’re delighted that we now have such beautiful and unique properties in our collection and we have a very talented team who support us in consistently delighting our guests and owners and improving our service offering all the time.”</p>

      <p>I adore the area, fully enjoying the outdoor lifestyle - running, ski touring and cycling in the most wonderful natural environment."</p>

      <p>"Scotland was always my favourite holiday location as a child and having moved to Scotland in 2006 from Warwickshire, I settled in the beautiful Cairngorm National Park in 2011. I have never looked back, partly due to the stunning location and partly due to meeting my Scottish husband and having our son, we are now lucky enough to be firmly rooted in the National Park.</p>
      <p>With over 20 years experience in hospitality and tourism, I started my training in a 5* hotel, which set me up with the high standards I have maintained throughout my career.</p>
      <p>I was delighted to join the team at Seasgair, working for a local company that is dedicated to luxury and the best guest experience is a real pleasure.</p>
      <p>I have a passion for ensuring our customers holiday exceeds their expectations. I love nothing more than adding some surprise and delight to well deserved breaks, whether that is giving tips on the best days out for our guests or maybe even a wee treat in their lodge for a special occasion."</p>

      <p>"Having spent the last 18 years working in Residential Letting & Property Management in Glasgow, accepting the position as Operations Manager with the Seagair team felt like the perfect fit for me following my recent move to the Cairngorms.</p>

      <p>My keen interest in property development, refurbishment and construction have played a big part of my life both professionally and personally. Purchasing and refurbishing a holiday home in the area was one of the best decisions my husband and I have ever made. It only took a few years for us to make the decision to relocate permanently!</p>

      <p>The National Park has stunning scenery and so much to offer both new & regular visitors of all ages. There is always something interesting to do, whatever the weather. I hope to enjoy much more cycling, hillwalking and skiing now that it is all on my doorstep."</p>

      <p>"Having spent all my life in the Aberdeen area, the Cairngorms National Park is always somewhere that I wanted to stay. Along with my wife, and our many Golden Retrievers, I have been a regular visitor to Aviemore area since the mid-80s.</p>

      <p>In November 2016 we were lucky enough to fulfil our dream and we bought our house in the National Park and we moved here full time in May 2018 when I retired from Police Scotland.</p>

      <p>We love the peace and tranquillity for the forest’s and spend many hours outside walking our two dogs. There is so much to do here and it seems that our “once a year” holiday has now become our daily way of life. Having all the wildlife on our doorstep is amazing and we often see deer and red squirrels in the forest near our house.</p>

      <p>In October 2019 I joined the Seasgair team as a Lodge Checker and spent the next 10 months getting to know the wonderful lodges that they look after and in August 2020 I became the full time Property Consultant with the team.</p>

      <p>It is just a fantastic place to live and work, and when I’m driving through the forest or across the moor, I think I have the best office in the world.</p>
