        <p>We want to safeguard the environment, strengthen our community and promote responsible tourism, for you, for future guests and future generations. Seasgair recognises the scale and speed of the climate crisis on our hands. We are proud to be stepping up to the mark by actively caring for our local habitat, planting trees, rewilding and doing our best to help and support those around us. Seasgair encourages you to get involved too, whether whilst on holiday or once you return home.</p>
        <p>We are delighted to work with Disability Snowsport UK (DSUK) and Save The Planet Academy via a donation from each guest booking. We also partner with Scotland: The Big Picture through the sponsorship of local projects. Our staff team actively raise funds throughout the year, by taking part in challenges and events.</p>

The website was created by Crieff based 10 year old Brandon Delaney in response to a school entrepreneur assignment.</p>
        <p>The website challenges schools, organisations and individuals to either buy eco-friendly products from the site which fund tree planting, or to plant trees themselves - at home, at school or in the community. The trees planted are logged on site and you can watch the Children’s Forest grow.</p>
        <p>The school educational programme empowers children to be ‘hands on’ and take action by sowing, planting and visiting trees. It also provides a wider focus around environmental, community and climate issues.</p>

      <h4>Sustainability</h4>
      <p>Within both our business and everyday lives we seek to make minimal impact through careful management of our actions. We use recycled products where possible, conserve energy and water use, ensure efficient local travel, reduce waste and recycle. We support the local economy - using services and suppliers with a similar ethos.</p>
      <p>Many of our lodges have wildlife feeders, attracting native species including red squirrel and pine marten, alongside information for guests about the ecology of the area.</p>

      <h4>Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</h4>
      <p>Craigard Lodge has a 7kW ‘Type 2’ electric car charging point for guest use. Local electric vehicle charging stations can be found via the site below: <a href="http://www.chargeplacescotland.org" target="blank" class="green-link">www.chargeplacescotland.org</a></p>

      <h4>Accessibility</h4>
      <p>Each Seasgair lodge is unique and characterful, as such we hope that guests of varying ages and abilities can enjoy a stay with us. Several lodges have downstairs bedrooms with en suite walk-in showers, alongside spacious living areas. The ground floor of Alltnacriche is fully accessible for wheelchair users, has wide doors and sufficient space around furniture.</p>
